# stremio-addon-unity

Very WIP addon to fetch the catalog and streams from [AnimeUnity](https://www.animeunity.so/) (Italian anime streaming website). I mostly use this for myself so expect bugs or lack of updates in case scraping details change.

## Adding to Stremio

On [Stremio Web](https://web.stremio.com), go to "Addons", click "Add Addon" and paste this link:

```
https://unity-worker-prod.plushdohn.workers.dev/manifest.json
```

## Usage

When you'll search something in Stremio at the bottom of the results you will see a new "Unity" catalog, and you can access content from there.

Note that results may take a few seconds longer to appear compared to the native Stremio catalog.
